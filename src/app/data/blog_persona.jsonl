Pretty much stuffs happened on friday. Ha. I think some people are just mentally retarded, and that's saying something. I mean like, that's the extend of immaturity you can get? You should just go away, you know, get out of people's sight cause the world's happier that way. And what's up with all those anti-boys thing? Go get a life, there's probably much more joy doing it. Also, I had to stand up for yongting (on a separate occasion) and damn IT, i have not done any. freaking. thing to deserve it. Personally, I think that our english teacher is also in the wrong. Honestly, what happened was that, at dismissal, the teacher was leading the class down 3 storeys. Yongting delvine and a few others of us had remedial after school. And the remedial classroom was at the 3rd storey. Yongting grabbed me and led me away from the rest of the class, heading towards the classroom. And so the teacher called us back this is something she said: \"Why did you (stray) away from the class? What if your parents are looking for you, and if they can't find you, what am I going to say? You should follow the class and not (wander) around on your own!\" PSHH!!! Firstly, WE HAD REMEDIAL. Did she expect us, to climb down 3 storeys, and CLIMB back up all the way again? She can do it herself if she wants to, I've got no problem with that. But no, I won't be doing it. That was her first mistake: she didn't even know what she was talking about. Secondly, what is it about my parents? Totally out of the point. We are dealing with different matters over here, and you can go to the extend of talking about my parents? Ha. Mr Lee once said that if you were arguing with someone, you should not get anyone else involved (verbally). Because, the 'fight' is between you and that person. Also saying that you shouldn't say \"YOUR MOTHER\" in a fight. Something like that. Anyway. I waited for her to finish up her scoldings, then I told her calmly that we actually had remedial at the 3rd storey, and that class was ALREADY dismissed, which meant we had the liberty to walk anywhere. I fully regretted not telling her this. \"Are you saying that we should inform you on our whereabouts every second of the day?\" Well I didn't say that, because that didn't come across my mind on that time. Anyway, she told me that we should have at least told her on where we're going. #3 mistake. So, right, like I've said, we have to inform her on our whereabouts everywhere? Hi teacher, I'm going to the toilet tomorrow afternoon, and later tonight, I will eat dinner. Are you fine with that? Ridiculous. I didn't want to cause a holdup so I bit back all my words. Too bad. And honestly, we won't go missing in our own school. So yeah, as she was scolding us, yongting merely hid in my shadow (lol) and said nothing much. So yes, it looked like it was all. my. fault. When she was the one who seized me. Now we all know life is just. so, unfair."}]}

Okay, maybe it's because I'm stoopid, I don't even know how to spell that word. Liye mental problem guy started talking about Ice Kachng (butt, in hokkien). Then he laugh like mad pig, then his laugh is sooper contagious that I sitting 4 meters away from him also laugh. Then he start crapping about spinning kachngs (getting offhand I know) and pointed to the fan on the ceiling and say it's a spinning kachng bla bla bla ... Then aft that CW go ask tht teacher what does ' hypothesis ' means. Reply: “ 科学的方面我就不懂。 ” So I say to her, it's like an assumption right, like your prediction bla bla. She say “ 是的，你说得对，是好像 presumption 的意 思 。” There is a difference between assumption and presumption right? One is intentionally, one is consciously right, or I rlly don't know. Eng sucks big. Assume, presume."}]}

And Devil saw that the light was bad. And God made springs which came out of the ground, oozing fountains of pure, fresh water. And God saw that the water was good. The Devil invented fizzy drinks. And saw that the fizzy drinks were bad. And God said, Let the earth bring forth vegetables, and the herb of the field, that the children may grow up healthy. And it was so. And the devil said, Let there be deep-fried potatoes. God said, Let the waters bring forth 10,000 varieties of fish, that they may provide sustenance for the children. And the Devil arranged that the fish be smothered in batter, deep fried, and served with deep-fried potatoes. God created the cattle of the field, and said, Behold, I have given you every living creature that moveth; to you it shall be for meat. And Devil showed how the meat could be minced and turned into burgers, and suggested that it should be served with deep-fried potatoes. On the seventh day, God rested and used the day to contemplate the wonders of creation. And Devil created the all-day brunch, cartoon TV channels, Sunday newspaper filled with articles about celebrities, that the minds of the children were filled with rubbish and their bodies filled with yet more deep-fried potatoes. God said to the boy to take the girl and go forth multiply. Devil invented the computer and recruited 10,000 demons to fill it with online battles. The boy part with the girl and instead cleave to the computer. God pointed out to the girl that he had made her with many attractive blandishments which she could use. The Devil invented the Nintendo DS Lite so that the boy will be able to take computer games with him wherever he goes. The Devil entered into the serpent and caused him to say to the girl and boy, The tree in the middle of the garden the Lord hath told you not to touch. But I say unto you, if you eat the fruit of the tree of knowlege, your eyes will be opened and you shall be gods. And the boy and girl said: No thanks. We liketh not fruit.

'B' and 'J' wrote posts on their blog about 'A'. Saying not so nice stuff. Someone told 'A'. Naturally, 'A' would complain to the teacher. 'D' was walking past 'A' in the canteen, when (in this case) she accidentally spilled milo on her own hand. 'D' said, \"Retarded\" to the milo and walked away. 'A' thought 'D' called 'A' a retarded, so she asked 'C', who was beside her, if 'D' did call 'A' a retard. AND 'C', (SUPPOSED TO BE ON D'S SIDE) answered in affirmative. 'W' talked to 'A' in facebook. Fact. - 'C' told 'A' that during choir break, ME. and a few others kept mentioning 'A', and kept talking bad stuffs about her (like wtf.) Me. Confronted 'C'. Via SMS. This is how it went. Me : You told 'A' that during choir break we keep talking about her? Dont keep denying leh. C : Wa lao eh?u tink i stupid?who tell u tis crap?I nvr larh C : No.i tell her 'U' sae de.bcoz 'U' hate her ma.i sae tat 'U' sae she damn slut.

I went to ask 'A' if 'C' told her that 'U' called her a slut. Lol. The answer was no. Conclusion: you liar . She. Has. Been. Backstabbing. Two. At. Once. Wow.

SINGAPORE: Singapore has confirmed its first case of Influenza A (H1N1).The patient is currently being treated at the Communicable Disease Centre at Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH) and is in stable condition. The patient is a 22—year—old Singaporean woman who was in New York from May 14—24.She arrived back in Singapore from New York on SQ25 on 26 May at 6.30am. She began to develop a cough while onboard. She passed the thermal scanner uneventfully as she did not have fever then. Later in the morning, she consulted a GP who decided to send her to TTSH via a 993 ambulance, given her travel history. She was immediately admitted for testing. Laboratory confirmation of her infection was made by midnight of 26 May. The patient has been vigilant in monitoring her own condition and had sought immediate medical attention once she realized that she was unwell. Her attending GP, through his quick response in activating the 993 ambulance for the patient, had also helped to minimize the spread of infection from this case. The Health Ministry says it has initiated contact tracing of her close contacts. They will be quarantined and provided with antiviral prophylaxis. Passengers who had travelled in the same flight and were seated in rows 52 to 58 are urged to call the hotline at 1800—333 9999 to enable the MOH to check on their health condition. The MOH adds that all medical practitioners and healthcare institutions should continue to be vigilant to suspect cases. Singapore will continue with temperature screening for passengers entering Singapore at all checkpoints (land, sea and air). All passengers passing through or entering Singapore are given Health Alert Notices on board their flights, advising them to monitor their own health if they have been to affected areas and to seek medical attention immediately if they are not well. original source: here omg la."}]}

Sometimes I REALLY feel like beating myself up for my hypocrisy. DAMN IT. Why am I so selfish, making mistakes huger than average human beings? I make mistakes like the next man, and they tend to be correspondingly bigger, and far worse. I think I'm sick of everything, the disguise that I had to wear. Why won't the world accept me for who I am? As the world evolves, society gets more demanding and ridiculous. Society has, indeed, become weaker than what it was years and generations ago. Everyone has to adapt, adjust to blend in the ever-changing environment. Enough about this. What I wanted to say was, I think it's very hypocritical on my part. -sigh- ... What do I honestly want in life? As for that, I have no idea. I guess, like what Albus Dumbledore said (I love him, but he's gay, unfortunately), no matter how sucky life is, it still HAS to go on right? So we should just live the present, not dwell on the past and (probably) look forward to the future. I guess he's right. To be precise, he's always right. Cause since when has he been wrong anyway? FYI, he's a fictional character. Hais ... As nobody is reading this blog, I guess I'll be not ashamed to announce that I was rejected from RGS really. Now, looking back, I honestly regret not working harder for the interview. It was the last phase, if only I tried abit harder. I'm sure Delvine will be accepted in. Very sure indeed. I guess I miss basketball too much. I'm feeling lethargic. Right, my dad's here, so I'll better logoff now. I'll need some sleep.

I must say, I'm really glad, because oral is the part of examinations which I hate most. That is because I am a very self-conscious sort of person, and I don't feel comfortable with 4 stranger eyes staring at me while I'm talking. I prefer hand-written exams alot, because nobody will be watching you (not that I am guilty, but I just don't like the feeling) and you will be able to take your time to think, and there will be no need to react fast to questions. Anyway, the picture was a little easy I think. I think it has a pretty good turnout today, and that I did quite well, at least, better than yesterday's english. Because I explained and interpreted alot. But there was a part where I was totally lost for words, so I really regret not saying something that time as it might have a really great effect on my total marks. No point crying over spilled milk now. I'm going to concentrate on the handwritten papers, which I sincerely hope, are way easier. Fat chance, because it's prelims paper, and everybody knows that the exam setters purposely set it a tad more difficult so as to not make us pin our hopes up too high. Which is probably good, because it will be sort of motivational for me. Oh yes, the fries are really horrible, the ones that cost $1.80 (really expensive!) from the minimart. I will have to bear a few things in mind though. 1. Return Michelle $1 (I owe her) even though she said there was no need. I am not a selfish person. I cannot take things for granted. I MUST return the money back to her. 2. Return 10cents to the minimart uncle. Repeat previous previous sentence. 3. Never buy that $1.80 hard fries again. Sucks really, I had a hard time trying to wash them down. I wish I had butterbeer. Oh, speaking about butterbeer, it's a purely fictional drink from the Harry Potter series. I really admire the author of the Harry Potter series very much, because she sounds nice and she has such a smart brain. Her vocabulary is just astounding. I wish I could extract some knowledge from her (in a good way of course). Harry Potter series are just awesome. Really. I think that most people in the world do not appreciate the Harry Potter series, because they do not read it. Especially younger ones like those around my age. They like to think them as 'childish' books, for example Christian, the boy sitting beside me. I hate this type of people. I mean, they have not actually read every single word in those 7 books, right? So they have not understood the whole storyline of Harry Potter. Therefore, they cannot judge, just by reading a book. That is called assumption. I know that Harry Potter doesn't sound all wisdom-y and stuff, but it's really just NICE, in my opinion. It has a very deep meaning to it. I think J.K Rowling wrote a very good storyline, from the start to the end. The ending is very wisdom-y like, really. There are parts which I don't understand. But it is an honestly deep thing, stuff like how Love is the deepest branch of magic, etc, etc. Well anyway, quite some time ago, I befriended some fictional characters on facebook. Of course, I know that those fictional characters are ... well, fictional. They don't exist, right? Because they are just figments of imagination of the author. But there they are. Really. And the weirdest thing is that, they seriously act like the fictional characters, like how J.K Rowling writes it. It's so uncanny to the highest degree that I can't help but think that they are real. But of course, they aren't. I must not kid myself with such things. If I'm not wrong, the Harry Potter Theme Park opened yesterday (18th August 2010). I really want to go there! I'm abit obsessed Harry Potter Series fan. I don't think I'll be going there anytime soon though, I think it's in Great Britain and I don't have so much time for it. After all, like I've said in my previous post, the final exams are coming and I'll really mug like hell now. I'll be only on the computer for posting. I'm really glad I thought up of this blog to keep my thoughts in. It's just like how Albus Dumbledore (in the Harry Potter Series) keeps his thoughts in his penseieve. I can't blame him, cause he's like, six hundred years old plus. No doubt his mind is crammed with memories. Being only twelve, I have to pour out my responses. How I wished I could be as carefree as those people I see sometimes!"}]}

Okay, so maybe I should elaborate. The reason why I created this blog is to store all my private/personal feelings and stuffs like that. I'm keeping this blog locked (viewable to me and only me) so yes, all these stuffs I'm saying are just like, for self-entertainment purposes, honestly. It's not for anybody in particular to read, mainly for myself. Anyway, I am perfectly aware that I have another blog, http://streetof-luv.blogspot.com/ . Yes, that's the blog that is viewed to everybody in the world (a.k.a public). Well, having a public blog has its disadvantages of course. You will not be able to record your thoughts freely in fear of someone else (who is related to your post, or rather, you bashed that person in your post) reading it and doing the unthinkable. Not only that, you will also be bombarded with annoying questions from irritating bugs, right after you posted a very interesting post or a post bashing somebody or something like that. And I am a person who does not like to be bombarded with crappy questions about my blog post. Because if I referred the person I bashed in the blog post as 'annoymous', people will start asking me who it is, and will not let the matter rest until I have told them. I do not like it. In order to prevent this type of things from happening, this blog is launched. I know it has a crappy URL, that's because it's not entirely new. I wasn't being very truthful. Well, it was an old blog that I used for blogskins-creating purposes, and as I do not need it anymore, I changed it into a private blog. The reason is because I could not create a blog. When I clicked 'create a blog', it simply brought me to a page where it said something like I had to key in my phone number for verification. Which looked really messy, not to forget take a very long time, so instead I used this blog to convert it into a private one. Tomorrow is CHINESE oral, I am quite confident (I think). That does not stop me from praying though. Today's was rather okay, not really that difficult but I must admit, I do not feel much towards it. It was over in a rush, so nothing much happened. Mdm Lua said, normally if that happens, it means that the examiners already have a rough idea what marks they are going to give you. I hope it will be a high one, but I must not pin my hopes up too high. After all, I know that I have missed a certain point, whether unimportant or not. I deeply regret it, but I shall not dwell on it. I am going to focus on my chinese one now. Really hope I do well tomorrow. Hope it is an easy picture. Now I know that the chinese picture will definitely not be the bus-stop or the beach anymore, as that was the places that were tested this year. I am really glad that the teachers gave everyone an oral handbook (for chinese). It really helps to improve alot. Hope everything goes fine tomorrow. I shall post if I have the time. Goodbye. P/s: I don't think I'll be letting anyone view this blog soon enough."}]}

I tried to stick to the word limit and did not write more than two pages. Cause if I write more than two pages, there is a high probability that the examiner will feel rather irritated at having to read such a long and tiring compo. If you remember, one examiner has to mark like almost hundred essays per day. If yours is going to take up her whole afternoon, she won't be too glad about it.

Those notes were really useful, I swear. They helped me alot in today's paper. I hope what everyone says about Prelims being harder than PSLE is true, because I hope the real one will be slightly easier. Well, I think I just gotta try my hardest for tomorrow. I MUST score above 90. I am really aiming for at least 90, or an A* for tomorrow's examination. Or 100 haha Because like my father said, Maths, is very possible to get a full marks for it (100). Unlike language subjects, it will be harder to score because in the first place, nobody can get full marks for the composition component, so that is already a great disadvantage and pulls your marks down. Meanwhile maths, has a fixed answer, unlike language, and with the correct figure, it is possible for full marks. These are my aims: (my father's, in short) English: 90 Maths: 95 Science: 85 Chinese: 85 Maths, as I've said, is possible to earn 100 for it. I have to keep going through those old papers and old questions (I'm going to do so later on) and learn from them, see how to arrive at the answer, and remember it. Science is kind of difficult (for me) because there are lots of concepts to understand and memorise. But as my dad says (and is almost usually right), Science is just all about concepts. Once you know them, everything's smooth. As for Chinese, I am glad I at least have a VERY pushy chinese teacher that is probably the root of my motivation towards Chinese this year. Sometimes, naggy teachers are awesome because they are the ones who push you to your limits, and help you score. Well, as I'm typing this, my brother is making me angry. Because he just ran towards the computer 1 second after my mother left it. And he's not doing any project of any kind, no worries yeah. He's actually playing Maple Story, which I really regretted downloading back for him now. I wish I can delete it, but he'll throw a fit if he finds out it's me (and he most likely will, who else would delete it?) and re-download it. Hais ... He is totally cutting my already limited computer time usage. Pray for tomorrow's maths for me! Thank you! WAHA"}]}

Alas, it cannot be changed, and hence, I shall resign to fate, or rather, let fate decide, and I will not decide my fate anyway.

I slept at 12.40 AM. Probably even later, cause I was up almost the whole time thinking about stuffs. In fact, I was thinking so damn much that I can't find the words properly now ... Anyway. Yesterday, my family went to watch the Fried Rice Paradise, the musical. Something ironic and drastic happened. At first, it was quite entertaining and funny, because the casts actually says those vulgarities and swear words out loud, which is something that I didn't have the luxury to enjoy back then. So I took that opportunity to listen as much as I can, taking in and absorbing all the words so that I can use them on others later. And the excuse would be nice: I heard it in Fried Rice Paradise. Excellente! (In attempt to sound french-like) Well anyway, this was what happened. At the beginning of the last scene, suddenly, the curtains came down (swish!) and the lights went out. And just a few minutes later, the technical director (angmoh leh!) went up to the stage there and started to say that there was a technical problem, and that we've been a very nice audience, so yeah, he's gonna try to fix it and that might take ten to twenty minutes. But after twenty minutes, it still failed. So yeah, it was disappointing, pretty much. But anyway, the cast explained that they would sing one last finale song, and then told us something about the GSR will contact us so that we can view the musical again. Well, in my opinion, FAT CHANCE. They might only contact those big shots. Not us. We are just too tiny, too insignificant to be noticed, or to catch their attention, or even worth their attention anyway. So yeah, I feel quite daunted, not to mention angry. Well anyway. I'm thinking about what I was thinking yesterday. Should I invite at least, my bestest friend to view this blog? I don't know. After all, it didn't really store MUCH private thoughts (yet). Really torn, I guess. Well, I doubt even my bestest friend will have enough time to view this blog, right? Grrr, I should really stop talking to myself, out loud. First sign of madness! I'm going to eat breakfast right now, it's chicken abalone noodles. Love it. The smell is wafting all the way here. Aww, so yummy. I'm salivating right now. Ah craps. And today I saw a gignatic bee (in fact just a few minutes ago). It was gignatic I tell you. Like, the size of half your fist closed. Really. When the wings flap, you can actually hear the sounds. (nothing to do with the buzzing I assure you) Okay then, I have like 10000,0000,0000 (times itself) more things to write, but I can't, right now. The figure might probably be increasing as I type though! So fat chance I'm gonna finish writing everything, cause there's no limit to what I write!

I reckon I'll do some posting before I get to bed. I put my alarm to 5.30AM. Which means that I will get less than 7hours of sleep today (and tomorrow). Sufficient sleep is, needless to say, important, but I am glad that I took a nap today so that would have replaced some of my sleeping time. As I have mentioned in my previous post, tomorrow will be the Chinese oral. I have been revising at the eleventh hour with my brother's handbook, which I only discovered recently. Really regret not finding it earlier cause it would have helped loads. Either way, I learned and absorbed quite a lot today (I think). As I have been napping today, I was thinking about some things. Before I get to that, I would just like to state a fact that I actually do my deepest thinking while in bed or in the bathroom. That's probably why I spend such a vast amount of my time in the bathroom, enlightening myself. Anyway, I was thinking about this blog today. It would be pretty difficult cramming twelve years worth of memories into this blog. Of course, I will only be writing those significant thoughts that I thought necessary to post, however unmeaningful they are. There are quite alot, come to think about it. My computer usage time is also extremely limited as my final examinations are drawing near as hell. Therefore, I would not have the time to blog too much. I have tried writing diaries and it sucked pretty much. That is because, even if I write at an extremely fast speed, I am not able to write in all the thoughts that have drifted across my mind, whether subconsciously, consciously or unconsciously. Those thoughts would have floated out within my grasp before I can even ponder or comprehend them. That's why I quit writing diaries. Recording them in posts are better. I must admit, and proudly, that my typing skills are quite fast. My record (facebook tells me so) is 100 words per minute. I assume that is quite alot, isn't it? That is because I have been on the computer for almost three-quarters of my life. Also (and my father constantly reminds me), I mature extremely fast. In fact, too fast for those my age. Everything in the world has its advantages and disadvantages, and so does maturing too fast. Sometimes I hate it alot, somethings I am so glad that I matured fast enough. I don't know. Thoughts are so difficult to sort apart. I would love to type some more, but I can't, unfortunately. I have already spent around nine minutes typing this post. I would need some sleep so that I can wake up refreshed and prepared for the day ahead. I am going to pray for myself, and I hope somebody is praying for me, as he says he will."}]}

GUARANTEED, imma going to watch sia! but if we lose, at least we have a medal right? FIRST TIME IN HISTORY/48 YEARS!!!!!!!!!!!!!! omfgomfomgomfomgomfomgf!!!!!!!!!!!!!! BEIJING, Aug 15 (Reuters) - Singapore were guaranteed their first Olympic medal since 1960 -- and only their second of all time -- by beating South Korea 3-2 on Friday to advance to the women's team championship final in table tennis. Singapore will face China, who coasted into the final 3-0 without dropping a game to Hong Kong. Somewhat dulling the achievement for the country of 4.6 million, the players and coach that carried Singapore to victory were all imports from table tennis powerhouse China. \"I feel very honoured. I've been in Singapore for just over two years and can help it get an Olympic medal, at least a silver, for the first time in 48 years,\" coach Liu Guodong said. Fired up by a vocal pro-Singapore crowd, world number nine Feng Tianwei was the key player, launching the contest with a rapid-fire win in the first match and closing it with a classy and controlled victory in the tense final match. Singapore beat the previously undefeated South Korea three matches to two in the best-of-five contest. Fans were treated to perhaps the finest table tennis of the Olympics yet in a match between Beijing-born Li Jia Wei, Singapore's top player at world number six, and Kim Kyung-ah, South Korea's best at 11th. CONTRASTING STYLES The contrasting styles of Li's aggressive topspin and Kim's defensive chops proved the perfect blend for rallies that regularly topped 20 hits. Li, who has been frazzled by nerves on big occasions before, showed impatience toward the end, rushing her forehand. Kim fell to her knees after sealing the win, 5-11 11-8 9-11 11-6 and 11-9. Despite the acrobatics of Korea's Park Mi-young in the fifth and deciding match, the unflappable Feng prevailed 11-7 12-10 3-11 and 11-9, winning when the Korean committed a rare error, faulting on her serve. \"In a battle like that, everyone is nervous. So if you can just keep it cool, you've got an advantage,\" Feng said. China's dismantling of Hong Kong in their semi-final prompted the venue managers to bring out a panda mascot for an unprecedented dance interlude, just to slow things down. Hong Kong's Tie Yana, world number 10, was hard pressed to find a flaw in the Chinese women. \"Weaknesses? It's tough to say,\" she laughed, saying no more.

You have the potential to break a lot of hearts. You know how what you want, how to get it, and that you will get it. You have the power to rule the world. Let's hope you're a benevolent dictator! You are friendly, charming, and warm. You get along with almost everyone. You work hard not to rock the boat. Your easy going attitude brings people together. At times, you can be a little flaky and irresponsible. But for the important things, you pull it together. You tend to be pretty tightly wound. It's easy to get you excited... which can be a good or bad thing. You have a lot of enthusiasm, but it fades rather quickly. You don't stick with any one thing for very long. You have the drive to accomplish a lot in a short amount of time. Your biggest problem is making sure you finish the projects you start. What's Your Name's Hidden Meaning? LOL!

WWF has now confirmed : Earth Is Dying Yet another crippling bombshell hit the beleaguered Earth community when the WWF confirmed that the Earth will be uninhabitable by 2050. Coming on the heels of a recent National Academy of Sciences report that the average temperature has risen yet again, this news serves to reinforce what we've known all along. The Earth is collapsing in complete disarray, as fittingly exemplified by failing dead last in the recent Galaxy-Wide species diversity test. You don't need to be a Kreskin [amdest.com] to predict Earth's future. The hand writing is on the wall: Earth faces a bleak future. In fact there won't be any future at all for Earth because Earth is dying. Things are looking very bad for Earth. As many of us are already aware, Earth continues to lose species. Extinction flows like a river of blood. The rainforest habitats are the most endangered of them all, having lost 93% of their area. The sudden and unpleasant departures of long time species black rhino and tiger only serve to underscore the point more clearly. There can no longer be any doubt: Earth is dying. Let's keep to the facts and look at the numbers. Earth leader Bush states that there are 7000 species left. How many mammals are there? Let's see. The number of mammal versus amphibian posts on Usenet is roughly in ratio of 5 to 1. Therefore there are about 7000/5 = 1400 mammal species. Rainforest reptile posts on Usenet are about half of the volume of amphibian posts. Therefore there are about 700 rainforest reptiles. A recent article put mammals at about 80 percent of the species market. Therefore there are (7000+1400+700)*4 = 36400 mammal species. This is consistent with the number of mammal Usenet posts. Due to the troubles of the rainforests, abysmal slash and burn agriculture, the drug war and so on, Columbian rainforests went out of business and was taken over by Brazilian rainforests who sell another troubled rainforests to international logging interests. Now Thai forests are also dead, its corpse turned over to yet another charnel house. All major surveys show that Earth has steadily declined in wilderness and species. Earth is very sick and its long term survival prospects are very dim. If Earth is to survive at all it will be among human dilettante dabblers. Earth continues to decay. Nothing short of a miracle could save it at this point in time. For all practical purposes, Earth is dead. yea, crap? i don't know. -.-"}]}
